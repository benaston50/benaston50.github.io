        <h1>COVID-19 and the Cost of Living in England</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="projectA">
        <h2>Aims of my Project</h2>
        <p> England has, in recent months, been plagued by a Cost of Living crisis. This includes a large level 
            of inflation, major increases in energy prices and wage increases which do not reflect such financial strain.
            By undertaking this project, I aim to discover if the COVID-19 Pandemic has contributed to England's 
            current Cost of Living crisis, and if so to what extent.</p>
        <p> I aim to examine different factors, such as the changes in various aspects of the Cost of Living, 
            how employment and earnings have changed and regional and societal variations in impact.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project1">
        <h2>How hard did COVID-19 hit each region of England?</h2>
        <p> Before analysing which regions of England are most impacted by the Cost of Living crisis, 
            I decided it would be beneficial to see the impact of COVID-19 on regions, allowing me to draw comparisons
            later between regions in terms of COVID-19 effect and the cost of living.
        </p>
        <div class="map-item" id="pChart1"></div>
        <p> As is visible in the chart, the North West and the South East had the highest number of coronavirus cases.
            This is likely due to the multiple major cities in these areas such as London, Manchester and Liverpool.
        </p>
        <p> However, due to higher populations in these areas this does not necessarily reflect the true impact of 
            COVID-19 on individuals, so I then found the number of people per positive COVID test in each region.
        </p>
        <div class="map-item" id="pChart2"></div>
        <p>
            This shows that COVID-19 levels were roughly similar in all regions but the South West and West Midlands 
            had the greatest per-person COVID rates, which could indicate COVID had a higher impact in these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            I retrieved this data from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">ONS</a> website and used an open source <a href="http://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/">GeoJSON Generator</a> to create the map of England.
            I could not immediately use the data and had to clean and standardise it first, and struggled initially to match
            region identities in both the map files and the data file. After analysing both files, I managed to fix all inconsistencies
            to get all regions functioning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project1">
        <h2>How does the Cost of Living compare between regions?</h2>
        <p>By comparing energy costs across regions through COVID, I can see to what extent each region is impacted by COVID.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart12"></div>
        <p>This graph shows that energy prices have shot up.
            It also indicates that the impact of the Cost of Living crisis is fairly consistent across regions, showing
            the regional cases of COVID had little to no impact on energy prices. This could be because energy prices
            were raised by an outside shock, or because restrictions were consistent across all regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this graph, I attempted to scrape data from a 3rd party site using different methods as seen on my colab, but the site
            had restrictions that I could not bypass with pandas or BeautifulSoup, so I opted to copy the table myself. As the data was
            very limited, I opted not to use it and instead use the public time series data from gov.uk.

        <h2>What are key metrics for the Cost of Living?</h2>
        <p>
            I believed it would give me a helpful insight into the Cost of Living crisis by looking into key metrics relating
            to inflation, both CPI and RPI related. I also wanted to compare this to changes in labour costs to see how worker
             pay has changed.

        <p>
            Multiple of these graphs, such as the CPI index, CPI energy weighting and RPI leisure goods weighting saw a 
            shock around COVID.
        </p>
        <p>
            In creating these graphs, I used Python code to access the ONS API and download time series all at once. This was 
            a struggle as each dataset had different timescales, so I had to pick data wisely and cater the code specifically 
            for each graph.

        <h2>How does Inflation relate to Unemployment?</h2>
        <p>
            Next, I wanted to analyse if inflation had a relation to unemployment, as COVID caused businesses to lay off many staff.
        </p>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart10"></div>
        <p>I also used Python code to run a regression AI.</p>
        <div class="picchart" id="pChart11">
            <img src="CPIVSUNEMP.png" alt="data" width= "480" height= "320"  >
        </div>
        <p>
            This showed the expected relationship. CPI and Unemployment are statistically significant with an R-Squared value
            of 0.438, meanining lower levels of unemployment leads to higher inflation levels. However, by hovering over the graph
            you can see many of the high points with low unemployment are recent, showing there is not lasting unemployment due to
            COVID and is instead a desire for workers from companies. For this data I had to standardise the timescales for the data.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            Through the graphs I have analysed in this project, I have come to the conclusion that the disruptions caused
            through COVID-19 are not significantly at fault for causing the current Cost of Living crisis, although it could
            have had minor impacts as a supporting factor to create a volatile economy.
